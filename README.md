Sun Haven E-commerce Store
This repository contains the code for the Sun Haven E-commerce Store, which consists of two main components: the ecommerce-backend and ecommerce-frontend. The backend is built using Node.js, Express.js, and utilizes various tools such as the Stripe API for cart purchases, PostgreSQL (PSQL) for the database, and Render for backend deployment. The frontend is developed using React.js, Redux for state management, and Firebase for frontend deployment.

Ecommerce Backend
The ecommerce-backend folder contains the code and configurations for the backend of the Sun Haven E-commerce Store. It is built using Node.js and Express.js, providing the necessary APIs and server-side functionality. The backend utilizes the following tools and services:

Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment used to execute server-side code.
Express.js: A fast and minimal web application framework for Node.js.
Stripe API: Used for handling cart purchases and payment processing.
PostgreSQL (PSQL): A powerful, open-source relational database management system.
Render: A deployment platform for hosting and scaling backend applications.
To set up the backend locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone <repository-url>
Navigate to the ecommerce-backend folder: cd ecommerce-backend
Install dependencies: npm install
Set up the database: Ensure you have PostgreSQL installed and running. Create a new PostgreSQL database and update the database connection configuration in config/database.js.
Set up environment variables: Create a .env file in the root of the ecommerce-backend directory and define the required environment variables. For example:
makefile
Copy code
PORT=3000
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
Start the server: npm start
Ecommerce Frontend
The ecommerce-frontend folder contains the code and configurations for the frontend of the Sun Haven E-commerce Store. It is built using React.js and utilizes Redux for state management. The frontend also integrates with Firebase for deployment. To set up the frontend locally, follow these steps:

Navigate to the ecommerce-frontend folder: cd ecommerce-frontend
Install dependencies: npm install
Set up environment variables: Create a .env file in the root of the ecommerce-frontend directory and define the required environment variables. For example:
makefile
Copy code
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_firebase_auth_domain
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project_id
Start the development server: npm start
Deployment
The Sun Haven E-commerce Store can be deployed using the following steps:

Backend Deployment
The backend can be deployed using Render, a hosting and scaling platform. To deploy the backend:

Create an account on Render (https://render.com/) if you don't have one.
Create a new web service on Render and link it to your GitHub repository.
Configure the necessary environment variables on Render, such as PORT, STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, and DATABASE_URL.
Deploy the backend using the Render platform.
Frontend Deployment
The frontend can be deployed using Firebase hosting. To deploy the frontend:

Create a Firebase project (https://firebase.google.com/) if you don't have one.
Install the Firebase CLI globally: npm install -g firebase-tools
Log in to Firebase CLI: firebase login
Initialize the Firebase project: firebase init
Select the Firebase features you want to set up (e.g., hosting).
Choose the Firebase project you created earlier.
Set the public directory to the build folder (usually build/).
Configure as a single-page application (SPA) if prompted.
Deploy the frontend to Firebase hosting: firebase deploy
